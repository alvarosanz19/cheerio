    <h4>IT STARTS with FAMILY</h4>
    <p>When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his
      daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to
    make sure that every family, including his, could share breakfast toguether.
  Since oats are naturally gluten free, the only problem was finding a way to make sure
they didn't get mixed up with anything else.</p>

  <h4>THE JOURNEY from FIELD to BOWL</h4>
  <p>Most of the farmers that grow oats wheat and barley, which aren't gluten free.
  Sometimes, those grains get mixed together in the field or on the farm, so, to make cheerios gluten free, we
had to separate them. It took a lot of late nights and hard work, but we finally discovered
a way to sort the other grains out of our oats.</p>

<div class="cheerios4everyone">
  <h4>CHEERIOS for EVERYONE</h4>
  <p>We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way
  of spending time together. Now that Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down
to share breakfast, and we couldn't be happier. After all, bringing families together around the breakfast
table is exactly why we are here.</p>
